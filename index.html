          <p>
            Welcome to Earth, the only planet we know of that hosts life! Covered in vast oceans, sprawling forests, and bustling cities, this blue gem is home to over 8 million species (and counting). Fun fact: Earth isn’t a perfect sphere—it’s slightly squished at the poles, making it an oblate spheroid. Fancy!

          <h1>Moon</h1>
          <p>
            Welcome to the Moon, Earth’s steadfast companion! With its cratered surface and silvery glow, the Moon has inspired countless myths, songs, and even scientific breakthroughs. Fun fact: The Moon is gradually drifting away from Earth—about 3.8 cm per year—but it still plays a crucial role in creating ocean tides and stabilizing Earth’s wobble. Amazing!
